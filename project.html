        <section id="early">
          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>Joseph Smith was born on December 23, 1805, in Sharon, Vermont. Raised in a poor but religious family, he grew up during the American religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening. As a young teen he prayed to know which church was true—an experience that led to a foundational event in his life.</p>

        <section id="vision">
          <h2>The First Vision (c. 1820)</h2>
          <p>Joseph described a vision in which God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him. That event — commonly called the "First Vision" — is understood by Latter-day Saints as the beginning of the Restoration of the gospel.</p>
          <div class="quote">"I saw a pillar of light... When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages... one of them spake unto me, calling me by name... This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"</div>

        <section id="restoration">
          <h2>The Restoration &amp; The Book of Mormon</h2>
          <p>Following the First Vision, Joseph reported further visitations and was given the golden plates, from which he translated the Book of Mormon (published 1830). In the early 1830s he organized the Church of Christ (later named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) and taught that priesthood authority and temple ordinances were restored to the earth.</p>

            <li><strong>Eternal Families:</strong> Through temple ordinances, families can be sealed for time and all eternity.</li>
            <li><strong>Scriptural Canon:</strong> Scripture includes the Bible, the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price (for those in the LDS tradition).</li>
